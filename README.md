This task is a demo application built in a short amount of time to showcase responsive web design. It is based on a Figma design and implemented using Next.js and TailwindCSS for styling.

Overview
The goal of this project was to implement a responsive design based on a given Figma design, ensuring that the layout, typography, color scheme, and functionality adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes. The application has been optimized for performance, focusing on smooth transitions and an efficient codebase.

Key Steps Taken
1. Analyze the Figma Design
Carefully studied the provided Figma design, including layout, color scheme, typography, and other design elements, to replicate the design faithfully.
2. Identify Breakpoints
Identified key breakpoints for both mobile and web views to ensure that the design adapts correctly to various screen sizes.
3. Use Responsive Design Techniques
Employed responsive design techniques including:
Fluid grids
Flexible images
Media queries These techniques ensure that the design remains adaptable and functional across different devices.
4. Test the Design
Thoroughly tested the design on multiple devices and screen sizes to ensure that it looks good and performs well.
5. Optimize the Design
Focused on optimizing the design by:
Minimizing the use of large images.
Removing unnecessary code to improve performance.
Technologies Used
Next.js (for React) – Front-end frameworks for building the app.
TailwindCSS – Preferred utility-first CSS framework for styling.
